 *
 * * Channel:     selected TX channel, either CHANNEL_TX or CHANNEL_TX1 can be used as there is only one TX channel.
 * * Job Index:   index number of the job, the scheduler processes the job table in ascending order of these index numbers. The index starts with 0, see the output of {@link tf_arinc429_get_capabilities} function for the total number of job indexes available. In firmware 2.4.0 it is 1000.
 * * Job:         activity assigned to this entry, see below.
 * * Frame Index: generally, the frame assigned to this job by the 'Frame Index' used along with the {@link tf_arinc429_write_frame_scheduled}.
 *                In case of a RX1 or RX2 retransmit job, the extended label (label + SDI) of the frame to be retransmitted.
 *                In case of the Jump command, the Job Index at which execution shall continue.
 *                In case of the Callback command, this number will be sent as 'Token' code (values 0-255 only).
 *                In all other cases (Skip, Stop, Dwell, Return) this parameter is not used.
 * * Dwell Time:  time to wait before executing the next job table entry (0-250 milliseconds).
 *
 * When the scheduler is set to 'run' mode via the {@link tf_arinc429_set_channel_mode}, it continuously loops through the job table and executes
 * the assigned tasks. It starts with the job stored at job index 0.
 * The scheduler can execute the following activity types (jobs):
 *
 * * Skip:        the job is skipped, i.e. no frame is transmitted and no dwelling is done. The frame index and dwell time are not used.
 * * Stop:        the scheduler is stopped, i.e. the channel mode is reverted from 'run' to 'active'. The frame index and dwell time are not used.
 * * Jump:        the scheduler immediately continues at the Job Index position given by the Frame Index parameter. The assigned dwell time will be executed when the scheduler runs into the next Return job.
 * * Return:      the scheduler immediately continues at the next Job Index position following the last Jump command. Nested Jumps are not supported. The frame index and dwell time are not used.
 * * Callback:    the scheduler triggers a callback message and immediately continues with executing the next job (dwell time is not used).
 * * Dwell        the scheduler executes the dwelling but does not transmit any frame. The frame index is not used.
 * * Single:      the scheduler transmits the referenced frame, but only once. On subsequent executions the frame is not sent until it is renewed via the {@link tf_arinc429_write_frame_scheduled}, then the process repeats.
 * * Cyclic:      the scheduler transmits the referenced frame and executs the dwelling on each round.
 * * Retrans RX1: the scheduler retransmits a frame that was previously received on the RX1 channel. The frame to send is referenced by setting the 'Frame Index' to its extended label code, which is a 10 bit number made of the label code in the lower bits and the two SDI bits in the upper bits. If the SDI bits are used for data, set the SDI bits to zero. As long as the referenced frame was not received yet, or if it is in timeout, no frame will be sent.
 * * Retrans RX2: same as before, but for frames received on the RX2 channel.
 *
 * The value assigned to the 'Frame Index' parameter varies with the activity type (job):
 *
 * * Single or Cyclic: frame index as used with the {@link tf_arinc429_write_frame_scheduled} of the frame to transmit. Valid range: 0-255
 * * Retrans RX1/RX2:  extended label (label + SDI) of the frame to re-transmit. Valid range: 0-1023
 * * Callback:         arbitrary number decided by the user, it will be reported in the callback via the 'Userdata' parameter. Valid range: 0-255
 * * Jump:             next job index to jump to.
 *
 * The {@link tf_arinc429_set_schedule_entry} can be called while the TX scheduler is running, i.e. the channel mode is set to 'RUN'.
 * Any change will take immediate effect once the scheduler passes along and executes the changed job entry.
 * Every time the scheduler is started, it will begin with the job stored at job index 0.
 * At the end of the programmed schedule there should be a 'Jump' command back to index 0 to avoid the scheduler wasting time in processing all the remaining 'Skip' commands.
 * Two or more TX schedules can be pre-programmed and then selected for execution by placing - and changing as desired - a 'Jump' at index 0 that then branches to the
 * sequence of commands destined to be executed. This can be arranged in arbitrary ways, e.g. to create schedules with fixed and variable parts, just by using the 'Jump'
 * command alike a track switch in railway.
 *
 * When the dwell time of a transmit command is set to zero, the respective Arinc429 frames will be transmitted back-to-back on the physical link.
 * Beware that there is a FIFO between the scheduler and the actual physical transmitter that is limited to 32 frames. So after latest 32 frames enqueued with zero dwell
 * time, the scheduler needs to be commanded to do some dwelling. How much dwelling is required can be computed by the number of back-to-back frames and the speed setting:
 * in high speed mode each frame takes 0.36 ms, in low speed mode 2.88 ms.
 * If a certain sequence of frames is to be transmitted multiple times in a schedule, this sequence just needs to be put once into the scheduler table with a 'Return'
 * command at its end. This way, this sequence can be called from multiple placed (job indexes) throughout the main schedule using the 'Jump' command.
 * Please note that this kind of calling a subroutine can not be nested, i.e. there is no return index stack, the 'Return' command always branches to the job index following
 * the index of the last 'Jump' command encountered. In case a dwell time > 0 is set with the 'Jump' command, this dwell time will actually be executed on encountering the
 * 'Return' command, thus as a dwell time to be done after the execution of the subsequence that was jumped to before.
 *
 * The 'Callback' command can be used to notify the application program via a callback when the scheduler passes at the respective job index. This can be used for pure
 * reporting / surveillance purpose, or as a means to set up a self-clocked system in which the called application program's function in return does some modification of
 * the programmed sequence or alike.
 * The scheduler can also be programmed to stop itself via the 'Stop' command, e.g. to run a pre-programmed, accurately timed single-shot sequence of frame transmissions.
 * Placing a' Callback' command right before the 'Stop' command will inform the application program via a callback when the sequence is done.
 * When using several 'Callback' commands in a schedule, each of them can be uniquely identified in the receiving application program by assigning a different 'userdata'
 * value to each callback command.
 *
 * With the aid of the 'Retrans' commands, a frame transmission schedule can be set up whose frame timing is defined by the schedule, but whose frame's payload is taken
 * from the frames received via the RX1 or RX2 channel. This opens possibilities to create an autonomously operating time base corrector or re-scheduling machinery, to
 * zip the frames from two A429 buses onto one common bus, to create inline filers to remove certain frames (by their label & SDI code), to insert frames into a stream,
 * to exchange the payload of certain frames on-the-fly, and much more.
