                    "SG Ready" is used as the control signal for the heating.
                    The SEB has two potential-free switching outputs for this purpose:
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Output 1 is used for blocking operation (SG Ready state 1).</li>
                        <li>Output 2 is used for the activation recommendation (SG Ready state 3).</li>
                        <li>If both outputs are not switched, normal operation takes place (SG Ready state 2).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    The intelligent winter/summer mode control uses output 2, and
                    the control according to ยง14 EnWG uses output 1. It is possible to connect only one of the two outputs
                    if only one of the two control types is needed.
