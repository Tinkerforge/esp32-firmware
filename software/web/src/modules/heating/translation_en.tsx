                <p>If the PV yield forecast control is enabled, the heating is put into extended operation if the forecast is below the set value.</p>
                <p>Example configuration: Extended operation with PV excess <b>above 1200W</b> or for <b>cheapest 4 hours per day</b> but only if PV yield forecast <b>below 10 kWh/day</b>.</p>
                <p>In this example, with a PV excess of 1200W, regardless of the following settings, the extended operation would be activated. In addition, the extended operation would be activated for the cheapest 4 hours per day, but only if the PV yield forecast was less than 10 kWh for the previous day. If a higher yield is expected, no extended operation is activated.</p>
                <p>Objective of these settings: If a high PV yield is expected, no electricity is drawn from the grid for extended operation, even if the electricity price is cheap.</p>
