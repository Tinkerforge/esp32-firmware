                    "SG Ready" is used as the control signal for the heating.
                    Two potential-free switching outputs are available for this purpose:
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Output 2 is used for the activation recommendation (SG Ready state 3).</li>
                        <li>If both outputs are not switched, normal operation takes place (SG Ready state 2).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    The intelligent winter/summer mode control uses output 2, and
                    the control according to ยง14 EnWG uses output 1. It is possible to connect only one of the two outputs
                    if only one of the two control types is needed.

                <p>Example: It is 05:00 in the morning and the active time is from 06:00 to 18:00. The PV yield forecast is enabled and the threshold is set to 50kWh, but the forecast only predicts a yield of 10kWh. In this case, an activation recommendation would be sent to the heating even outside the active time if the electricity is cheap.</p>
                <p>The idea is to use the cheap electricity at night when it is known that the sun will not shine during the day.</p>
