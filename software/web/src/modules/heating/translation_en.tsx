                <p>If the PV excess control is enabled, the heating is put into extended operation as soon as the excess at the grid connection exceeds the set value.</p>

                <p>If the PV yield forecast control is enabled, the heating is put into extended operation if the forecast is below the set value.</p>
                <p>Example configuration: Extended operation with PV excess <b>above 1200W</b> or for <b>cheapest 4 hours per day</b> but only if PV yield forecast <b>below 10 kWh/day</b>.</p>
                <p>In this example, with a PV excess of 1200W, regardless of the following settings, the extended operation would be activated. In addition, the extended operation would be activated for the cheapest 4 hours per day, but only if the PV yield forecast was less than 10 kWh for the previous day. If a higher yield is expected, no extended operation is activated.</p>
                <p>Objective of these settings: If a high PV yield is expected, no electricity is drawn from the grid for extended operation, even if the electricity price is cheap.</p>

                <p>From 01.01.2024, ยง14a EnWG requires the controllability of heat pumps in Germany. Specifically, newly installed heat pumps must have a communication interface to the grid operator such that the grid operator can adjust the power of the device in exceptional cases.</p>
                <p>The control according to ยง14a EnWG can be activated here. For this purpose, an input is controlled by the grid operator and in return the heat pump is controlled via the SG Ready output 1 according to the input.</p>
                <p>Note: The control according to ยง14a EnWG takes precedence over the heating control configured above.</p>

            "control_period_help": <>
                <p>The control period determines for which period the control rules are active.</p>
                <p>Example configuration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control period: 24 hours</li>
                    <li>Extended operation: Cheapest 8 hours</li>
                    <li>Blocking operation: Most expensive 8 hours</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this case, it can happen that up to 8 hours at a time the extended operation and up to 8 hours at a time the blocking operation is switched on. Assuming the heating must run at least 2 times a day to maintain a desired temperature, the following configuration might be appropriate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control period: 12 hours</li>
                    <li>Extended operation: Cheapest 4 hours</li>
                    <li>Blocking operation: Most expensive 4 hours</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this configuration, the day is divided into two 12-hour control periods in which the cheapest/most expensive hours are determined and accordingly the heating can be brought into extended or blocking operation for a maximum of 4 hours at a time per 12 hours.</p>
