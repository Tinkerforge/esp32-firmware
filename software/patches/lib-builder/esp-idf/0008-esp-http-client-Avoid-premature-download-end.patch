Subject: [PATCH] esp-http-client: Avoid premature download end

esp_http_client_get_data (actually esp_transport_read) might
return 0 with errno == 0 (indicating all data has been received)
before all data has actually been received. This is most
likely a bug in esp_transport_read itself. Instead of finding
an fixing that potetial bug, work around it here by assuming
errno == EAGAIN in case not all promised data has been received.
