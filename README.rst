ESP32 Firmware
==============

This repository contains the firmware source code and the source code of the
web site, all released firmwares and more.

Repository Content
------------------

provisioning/:
 * Scripts for mass provisioning of ESP32 modules

software/:
 * modules/: Modules that can be emplaced in the firmware and web interface
 * build/: Compiled files will be put here
 * src/: The source of the selected backend modules will be put here
 * web/: Source of the web interface

Software
--------

See software/README.txt for build instructions.
More documentation of how the software and the build process work
will follow in the future. For now in brief:

* The software is built with https://platformio.org/
* In software/platformio.ini backend (i.e. firmware) and frontend (i.e. web interface) modules
  can be selected to be compiled in the firmware.
* Custom hooks compile the web interface from Typescript and Sass into Javascript and CSS,
  place everything in one HTML file, zip it and create a C header that is then compiled in the firmware
* After the firmware is built in the software/build folder, the custom hooks
  merge the firmware, bootloader, partition table, etc into one bin file that can be flashed
  on the ESP32 Brick at offset 0x1000 or can be uploaded to a running WARP Charger.
