warp-more-hardware ESP32 firmware
=================================

This is the README.md for the warp-more-hardware project that 
adds support for more hardware than just the awsome stuff that 
[TinkerForge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/) has to offer.

*The [README.rst](README.rst) is really worth a read as well!*

> **Please make sure not to bother the TinkerForge people when you**  
> **encounter issues with this fork of the software running on non**  
> **TinkerForge hardware.**

Please use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/warp-more-hardware/esp32-firmware/issues) instead.

Or even better, join the project, fix it yourself and open a 
[pull request](https://github.com/warp-more-hardware/esp32-firmware/pulls)

Find more information on how to build the software yourself 
in the [software/README.md](software/README.md).
